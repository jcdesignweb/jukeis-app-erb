## Getting Started

Follow these steps to install and run Jukeis on your system.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (version >= 16.0.0 recommended): Required to run development scripts and build the application. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm** or **yarn**: Package managers for Node.js. They usually come installed with Node.js.

#### Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file else the project will fail


`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` your google client id (you must create an application at https://console.cloud.google.com/)

`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` your google client secret app

`GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` redirect callback for Oauth2

`ENCRYPTION_KEY` encription hash master key Example: 'fBcDeFgHiJKLmNooqZsTuVwXyZ019124'


### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if it's open source):**
    ```bash
    git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd jukeis-app-erb
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    If you use npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    If you use yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running

1.  **To run in development mode (with hot-reloading):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will open the Jukeis application in an Electron window with developer tools active.

2.  **To build the application for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    This command will generate the packaged application files for your operating system in a `dist` folder or similar.

3.  **To run the built application:**
    Navigate to the folder where the packaged application was generated (`dist` or similar) and run the executable file (e.g., `Jukeis` on Linux/macOS or `Jukeis.exe` on Windows).

## Usage

Once you have run Jukeis, these are the basic steps to start using it:

### Creating a Vault

* On the first launch, you will be prompted to create a **master password**. Remember this password well, as it will be the key to access all your other passwords!
* Jukeis will create a local password vault protected by this master password.

### Adding New Passwords

1.  Click the "Add Password" button (or a similar icon).
2.  Fill out the form with the following information:
    * **Title:** A descriptive name for the password (e.g., "Gmail", "Facebook").
    * **Password:** The password you want to save. *(Optionally, you can use the password generator if you implemented it)*
    * **Group:** Select or create a group to organize this password.
    * **Notes (Optional):** Any additional information you want to save.
3.  Click "Save".

### Viewing and Copying Passwords

1.  Select the password you want to view from the list.
2.  For security, you may need to re-enter your master password to reveal the passwords.
3.  Once revealed, you will be able to see the password.
4.  Click the "Copy" button (usually a clipboard icon) to copy the password to the clipboard. Remember that for security, the copied password might disappear from the clipboard after a while!

### Organizing with Groups

* You can create new groups to organize your passwords (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Banks").
* When adding or editing a password, you can assign it to a specific group.
* The interface might allow you to filter or browse your passwords by group.

## Technologies Used

* **Electron:** Framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* **ERB:** Electron React Boilerplate.
* **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Ant Design:** UI component library for React that provides a set of ready-to-use and styled components.
* **[Other Libraries/Frameworks you used]:** (e.g., `react-router-dom`, any encryption library, etc.)
